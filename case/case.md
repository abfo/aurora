# Aurora Case

This folder contains files to print a case for the Adafruit BrainCraft version of Aurora. 

## Design

I used [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/) to design the case. The .scad files (case, lid, button, strut) can be edited using this software.

## Print

The .stl files (case, lid, button, strut) are ready to slice and print. You'll need two struts and one of each of the other parts. 

## Assembly

In addition to the printed parts you will need 6 M2.5 screws and optionally wall mounting hardware. Screw the Raspberry PI 4 onto the mounting holes in the case. Attach the BrainCraft HAT and screw on the two struts to act as spacers where the board is not supported by the connector. Slide in the lid, and then push the button cap onto the 5-way button on the HAT. Mount to a wall if desired.
